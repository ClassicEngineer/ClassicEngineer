- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClassicEngineer, I am coding since 2016
- 💪 My strongest knowledges are Java and backend development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and React
- 📫 How to reach me ... it is a secret(shhhh)

Why this github is so empty? Because my previous two github accounts were deleted and this account is new one. Fortunately, there was only trash-code which is a shame to show 😌

See my [blog](https://doka.blog) to get an additional info about me.
